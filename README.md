The project is basically about to solve the queue problem in doctors clinic so that user can do others work unless his turn is not come. He/she can monitor his number of queue from the app once he /she get to know that it is so close or about to come he/she can get to the clinic. this will solve the unnecessary problem of standing in queue and wasting their productive time.
